# \package shaderComp.shaders
# \brief This package contains a set of low level mathematic functions usable as shaders in a project
# \version 0.1
# \date 2013-11-08
# \details The goal of the api is to be able to build shaders from a low level set of math function. 
# Here are some of these functions, and an exemple will show how to build a simple fog shader from these functions. 
# \see my_fog.py
# \example my_fog.py
